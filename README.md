# Eneroth Hide Locked

his plugin allows you to hide an unhide entities, even if they are locked. This can be useful if you need to toggle visibility but don't want to accidentally move anything.

Activated from Context Menu > Hide/Unhinde (Despite Locked). In SketchUp 2016 and newer on Windows this entry appears just below the usual Hide/Unhide entry. For earlier versions and on Mac the entry is found somewhere near the bottom of the context menu.
